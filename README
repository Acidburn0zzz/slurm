slurm - yet another network load monitor

*** see Changelog for Changes ***

slurm started as a FreeBSD port of the Linux ppp link monitor called pppstatus
by Gabriel Montenegro. Hendrik Scholz ripped of the ppp dependent parts and the
email checks to turn in into a generic network load monitor for *BSD, Linux,
HP-UX and Solaris.

features:

    - "realtime" traffic statistics
    - three graph modes: combined RX and TX and two split views
    - can monitor any network device
    - curses ascii graphics
    - ascii theme support

slurm was tested on:
 - Debian GNU/Linux
 - FreeBSD 10

Compiling:
 - Install cmake
   e.g.:
    apt-get install cmake

    mkdir _build
 - Run cmake to create the Makefiles
   cd _build/
   cmake ..
 - Run make to build the binary
